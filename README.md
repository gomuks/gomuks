A Matrix client written in Go using [mautrix](https://github.com/mautrix/go).

This branch contains new gomuks, which consists of the backend, and web and
terminal frontends. The new terminal frontend is still experimental and doesn't
have many features, but basic messaging should work. For legacy gomuks terminal,
see the [master branch](https://github.com/gomuks/gomuks/tree/master).
